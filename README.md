# MEAN Starter, Angular 5 + Angular CLI
MEAN stack starter pack with Angular 5, made with Angular CLI 

## PERFECT FOR NEWBIES

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.
This makes it fairly simple to use and understand by people who don't have a great understanding in Angular

## How to start
- Clone the repository
- Run ```npm install``` to install the needed dependencies
- Run ```ng build``` to build the project
- Run ```node server``` to start the server

## How to make changes
- Edit the part of the code
- Run ```ng build``` again to build the project with the changes
- If the project gets recognition I might write a script to automate this

## Project Structure
- dist folder - that is where all the client-side code is put when running ```ng build```, used in order to be accessed from the server
- e2e folder - contains the end to end tests
- server folder - This is where all the server logic should be. It currently only has a file for the API routes.
- src - This is where the actual Angular is, refer to the angular-cli docs for detailed info
- server.js file - This is the file that starts the whole server, the code there is pretty straight-forward and it has comments.
